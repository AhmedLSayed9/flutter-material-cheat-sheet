# Flutter Material Cheat Sheet 📝

Welcome to the cheat sheet for the Flutter Material package! This document should give you an overview of the different naming (there has been a change in the Material spec in 2018), where each Material widget uses which text style and which colors...

As you can see, Flutter uses an older specification for the naming (they kept the old one in order to be backwards compatible), e.g. `headline1` is `display4` or `body1` equals `body2` - simply compare the `Flutter API` column.

## Colors
